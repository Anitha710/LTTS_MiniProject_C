# Project Information

Digital Memo is based on concept to generate Personal Daily Records and to add records and update it. Here User can add their daily details safely and its not time consuming. Each Section contains high security so there is no chance of data loss. There’s maximum privacy to the recorded files. This system makes easy to store daily records. The whole project is designed in ‘C’ language and different variables and strings have been used for the development of this project. This mini project is easy to operate and easily understood by the users. This is a simple mini project in C, built as a console application without using any graphics features. It is easy to operate and understand by the users. There is no any error and warning contents in the project. The design is so simple that user won’t find it difficult to use and navigate.

In this console application, you can add, view, edit and delete records. Records can be added with many information such as duration of task, name, address, time and date. File handling has been effectively used to keep the records.
  
In this project, you need to enter a password to view, edit or delete record. Password is not required to view the main menu or to add record. We have used password in other mini projects in code with C; what’s little different in this project is that you can edit the password within the application i.e, after executing or upon running the project
